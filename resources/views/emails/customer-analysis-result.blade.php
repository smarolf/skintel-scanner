                                @case('redness')
                                    Redness can be caused by inflammation, sensitivity, or conditions like rosacea. Our recommended products contain soothing ingredients like niacinamide and centella asiatica to calm irritated skin and reduce visible redness.

                                @case('texture')
                                    Uneven skin texture often results from dead skin cell buildup or enlarged pores. We've selected gentle exfoliating products with AHA/BHA and retinoids to smooth your skin's surface and promote cell turnover.

                                @case('oiliness')
                                    Excess oil production can lead to shine and clogged pores. Our curated products include oil-controlling ingredients like salicylic acid and niacinamide to balance sebum production without over-drying your skin.
                                    @break
                                @case('dryness')
                                    Dry skin lacks moisture and can feel tight or flaky. Your recommended routine includes hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and glycerin to restore and maintain optimal moisture levels.
                                    @break
                                @case('poreVisibility')
                                    Visible pores are often caused by oil buildup and loss of skin elasticity. We've chosen products with pore-minimizing ingredients like niacinamide and retinoids to help tighten and refine your skin's appearance.

                                @case('darkCircles')
                                    Dark circles can result from genetics, lack of sleep, or thin under-eye skin. Our selected eye care products contain caffeine, vitamin C, and peptides to brighten and strengthen the delicate eye area.

                                @case('acneScarring')
                                    Acne scarring occurs when breakouts damage the skin's deeper layers. Your routine includes ingredients like vitamin C, retinoids, and alpha hydroxy acids to promote healing and fade post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
